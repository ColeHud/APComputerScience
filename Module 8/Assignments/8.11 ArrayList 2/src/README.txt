***************************   PMR  **************************************
 
<+s>: This was rather straightforward, without many complex algorithms to throw me off, so this program went really well.
Having the methods that I need listed out, as well as how the output is formatted was really helpful.
      
<-s>: I struggled for a while on how to get the indices of the array into the individual objects, but then I realized that I could add the to a method to be thrown in with 
the rest of the methods called in the loop within main().
           
*************************************************************************
The hardest part of this whole assignment was formatting the output, I easily spent 3x as much time on that as writing the program. In the future
I need to try and get the formatting done quicker. 

On a side note, Battlecode starts tomorrow! I'm super excited for it, and I can't wait to put my new java skillz to use! 

Robotics build season also starts tomorrow, and I'm pushing for our team to use Java instead of LabView. I'm the only person on the team who could maintain that 
code, but it would be really cool! I usually think of Java as being very "high-level", but it would be cool to try writing code for physical robots in it (forget C!).
