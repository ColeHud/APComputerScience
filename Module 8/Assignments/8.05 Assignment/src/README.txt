***************************   PMR  **************************************
 
<+s>: This program had some challenges along the way, but went pretty well. I'm really getting a hang
of the constructor arguments.
      
<-s>: I struggled a little bit with the updated printData() function, but eventually got it.
           
*************************************************************************
I was somewhat confused as to why I would initialize the distance, cost, mpg, and gpm variables in the main
method when it would work just fine in the constructor. In the future I'm going to try messing around with the
updated constructor to get a better grip of it.
