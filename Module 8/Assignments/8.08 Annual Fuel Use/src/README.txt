<+s>: My program logic worked flawlessly first time through without hardly any tweaking. I found it
helpful to divide this program up into 5 classes rather than just 2; this helped me to divide up the 
logic in a more organized way.
      
<-s>: Some of my printf statements were again formatted incorrectly which took some time to rework.

This was one of the most time consuming programs that I've written so far, but the satisfaction at the end
was all worth it.
