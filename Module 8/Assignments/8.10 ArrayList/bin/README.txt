***************************   PMR  **************************************
 
<+s>: This PMR is pretty much the same as the last one. Most of the good things, and bad things are the same. 
I was really happy that I got to try some method and constructor overloading in this program, and it turned out
well. Another good thing is that I discovered that eclipse will automatically make me getter and setter methods! 
This is SUPER helpful!
      
<-s>: I messed up on one of the methods and forgot to place in real values, rather than parameters.
           
*************************************************************************
Unfortunately, my parents throw away their bills right after they pay them, so the only info I was able to get was
from the internet, and the records from my parent's checkbook (only goes back 2 months). I wrote a small script to 
randomize some numbers within the range of our last 2 payments which I then used for the other months. I got the 
price per kwh online from current records in our area, and that was the average for the past year. 

In the future it would be really nice if my parents didn't throw out their bills :)
