<+s>: It was rather straightforward converting the old CarV5 class to work with multiple objects and classes.
Not much went wrong with this program.
      
<-s>: I was having trouble making the intance variables visible, so I set some of them to be visible to the entire
package. I forgot to remove the title from the printData method, which led to a new title being printed every time I 
called printData().
           
*************************************************************************
In the future I can see how instead of making individual objects, I could instead make an ArrayList of objects so that 
I can dynamically add cars, rather than having to type in an object for every new car. After looking at this data, maybe
my family should turn in our Sienna for a Prius!
