<+s>: This program was relatively easy for me. Over the last few days I've
written a tic-tact-toe program using some of the OOP techniques, and that
really helped me out here.
      
<-s>: I don't really have anything bad to say about this program.
           
*************************************************************************
I'm really loving OOP! It might take a bit more time, but it adds a layer of organization to
my programs that's really helpful. This summer I took a Javascript course online, and in one
assignment we had to make laser-shark objects with certain attributes to hunt down rogue penguins.
I don't think we'll do anything that crazy here, but I find OOP to be really fun. In the future I hope 
that my OOP programs go this well.
