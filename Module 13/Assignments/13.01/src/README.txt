***************************   PMR  **************************************
 
<+s>: I've been wanting to extend classes for a while, and now I finally get the chance! All of these classes
were really straightforward to write without much more than a constructor. 
      
<-s>: Not much went wrong with this assignment. The only thing that I needed to watch out for was the super constructor.
           
*************************************************************************
In the future I hope that we do a lot more with inheritance. This definitely makes a lot more sense to me than recursion.
While this assignment went really well, I hope that we get to do some more complex/abstract assignments with inheritance.
