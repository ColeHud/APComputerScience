<+s>: I enjoyed this assignment a lot more than the previous two! Everything went smoothly on this assignment.
This assignment demonstrated good code reusability and a good example of overriding methods. 
      
<-s>: The toString() method didn't run perfectly the first time through. I had neglected to add in the changes to both
of the super classes.

In the future I need to pay more attention to detail. While this assignment went well, it could have gone even better if
I'd paid attention to the details.
