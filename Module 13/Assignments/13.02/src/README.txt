***************************   PMR  **************************************
 
<+s>: Class hierarchies are really starting to make sense to me. I'm starting to see a lot of different applications for
this. This assignment in particular went well. I didn't run into any problems.
      
<-s>: There weren't any negative parts to this assignment. The class hierarchy diagram in the instructions helped a lot to
reduce confusion.

If I could do this assignment again I wouldn't change anything. I'm getting really excited for more of the complex assignments
coming up where we get to put this to use.
