<+s>: This was a really interesting topic to write about. It made me think more about my views on IP laws.
      
<-s>: I ran over by about 60 words which couldnâ€™t be helped if I wanted to fully flesh out my ideas.

In the future I should try and make a better effort to confine my essay to 250 words.
