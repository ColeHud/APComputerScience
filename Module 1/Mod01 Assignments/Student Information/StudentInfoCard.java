PROJECT TITLE: 01.05 School Information / SchoolInfoCard.java
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Use print statements to print information about me.
VERSION or DATE: 09/09/14 
AUTHORS: C. Hudson

**************************** P M R *********************************************
 
<+s>: Formatting everything was easy when I organized it into sections. It was also easy because 
it was very similar to other languages I have used. Sublime text was very helpful by color coding everything.
      
<-s>: I didn't read all of the directions first, so I had to completely redo my program.
It was annoying having to put everything in a separate statement.
           
*******************************************************************************
In the future I plan on reading through all of the directions before beginning a program.
If possible, I would also like to be allowed to use just one statement.
