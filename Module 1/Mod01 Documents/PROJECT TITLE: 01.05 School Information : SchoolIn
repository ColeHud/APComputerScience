**************************** P M R *********************************************
 
<+s>: Using the BlueJ editor was easy.
      The syntax of print statements is straightforward, but I kept forgetting to use println( )
      to force a line feed after using print( ).
      
<-s>: Lining everything up took a lot of time.
      Made frequent typos.
           
*******************************************************************************
In the future: It probably would save time to write out on paper how to arrange all of the output
instead of guestimating.  Need to pay closer attention when typing to reduce silly typos.
