<+s>: I don't really have that much positive to say about this assignment. Once I got everything working, it worked well, 
but it took me a while to get there.
      
<-s>: This assignment confused and frustrated me. I didn't pay enough attention to the .close() methods and where they had to 
be placed. I forgot to close the printwriter before before I used the scanner which caused a ton of problems. 
           
*************************************************************************
In the future I need to pay more attention to details with the PrintWriter and Scanner classes. A couple silly errors in both those
areas caused me to rewrite this program over and over, as well as make it extremely late.
