<+s>: My first time through everything went really well. I wrote the program without using the
skeleton program we were given. Within a few tries I had everything working well. 
      
<-s>: There is a lot of repetitiveness in my program since I made a variable for each total, and an if loop
for each total as well. My code runs fine, it's just so repetitive.

I'm really glad that I used your advice and just got the basics done the first time around. I could still be working on
this program right now if it wasn't for that. In the future I'll try to do the same thing.


--In the grading rubric it said that some questions were supposed to be answered here, but I couldn't find any of the 
questions.
