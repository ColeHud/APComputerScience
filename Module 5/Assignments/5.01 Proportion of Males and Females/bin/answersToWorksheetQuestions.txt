Part 1, question 7:
    What happens as the number of trials increases? What do you predict for a trial of 100000 coin tosses?

	-> As the number of trials increases, so does the difference between the 2 numbers, but the percentaes get much closer. I predict a trial of 100000 coins to be 50300:49700.

Part 2, question 6:
	What do you predict for a trial of 100000 coin tosses?

	-> With a 30%:70% coin, I would predict for a trial of 100000 coins that it would end up 30400:69600.

Part 3, question 7:
	What happens as the number of trials increases?
