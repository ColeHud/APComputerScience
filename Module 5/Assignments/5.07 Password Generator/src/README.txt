***************************   PMR  **************************************
 
<+s>: This went relatively well. My code worked wonderfully, but I can definitely see how these assignments are
getting steadily more complex.
      
<-s>: It took me a couple tries to make it so that the program wouldn't ask you for the password length after you
had chosen "Exit". 
           
*************************************************************************
In the future I really need to work on not saving all of this work until Sunday. I need to get through my head that I'm going to have
to work on this every day.




Questions from the assignment:

7.) I think that memorable passwords are better. For example, my grandma has a password that isn't very memorable and has to look
it up quite frequently. I have a very complex but memorable password that I never have to look up. You can have passwords that are
both memorable and hard to break, which is a lot better than random passwords that you have to look up all the time.

8). Ou812maNY&DyeD -> very strong -> It's memorable because my mom came up with it a while ago jokingly as a password.
	SeEPlus+&JaVaru1e -> very strong -> PROGRAMMING!
