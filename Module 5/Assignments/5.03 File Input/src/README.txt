***************************   PMR  **************************************
 
<+s>: This program went pretty well for me. I found it really helpful to just try the program with a sample size of about
5 families to see if things were working. Originally I had 2 if statements to check for the mixed family, but eventually I 
figured out how to do it with only one.
      
<-s>: I had trouble at first with the text file, but eventually I got that working. It'll take some practice before I get good
at using text files in programs. When creating the percentages towards the end of the program I messed up and forgot to convert
them to double.
           
*************************************************************************
Like I said earlier; I need a lot more practice working with text file input. I'm really excited to move onto writing to files.
Overall I was pleased with how this program went. In the future though, I'm going to try to stay more on track so that I'm not 
turning assignments in on Sundays.
