<+s>: I really liked the algorithmic thinking in the second part of the assignment. I get a lot of
gratification out of solving problems like that. I first wrote the algorithm out on paper and then I 
tested it to see if it worked. I was also really pleased with the way the first part of this assignment
went. My first try of running the code everything worked perfectly.
      
<-s>: I don't really have any negatives for this assignment. I really enjoyed it and everything went 
smoothly.
           
*************************************************************************
In the future I will definitely try working the algorithms out on paper again. I have also been trying
to be a bit more verbose with my variable names which has been helpful. I will keep trying to work on that
as well.
