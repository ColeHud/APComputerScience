***************************   PMR  **************************************
 
<+s>: This went pretty well, my code ran perfectly (I thought) the first time I ran it.
      
<-s>: I didn't pay attention to what I said in the last PMR, I went over the assignment instructions, but I forgot to 
go over the grading rubric. I completely forgot to use a for loop or a while loop. This forced me to go back and rework most
of my code.
           
*************************************************************************
In the future I definitely need to first go over the assignment instructions thoroughly, then I also need to go over the
grading rubric.
