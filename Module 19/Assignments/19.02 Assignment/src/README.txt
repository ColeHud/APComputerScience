<+s>: I liked this assignment quite a bit. These past 2 have really helped me
to understand exceptions better. Sometimes, when I throw errors using an API, I get
some light-hearted exception statuses. I'm trying to add a bit of that to my own
code.
      
<-s>: Not having the full example was slightly confusing, but I managed to get by.
Other than that, everything went pretty well.

On a completely different note:

I've been really noticing the effects of taking this class. I've been finding it 
a lot easier to pick up other object-oriented languages, and my ideas are coming
out much more cleanly.

P.S. I don't remember if I mentioned this to you, but I ended up getting accepted into
Stanford's Online High School. I'm super excited, because they have a follow-up course
to AP Computer Science!
