***************************   PMR  **************************************
 
<+s>: This assignment went pretty well for me. I can see how this would be super useful when
designing an API, or code that's going to be used by someone else. The idea of the exception 
class is really interesting to me, so I think I might look into it more.
      
<-s>: I don't have anything negative to say about this assignment; everything went almost perfectly.
I could still do a better job reading instructions, though. My toString() method could also use some
improvement.
           
*************************************************************************
Like I mentioned earlier, I think that I might look into the exception classes more in the future. It seems
really interesting and useful. If I were to do this assignment again, the only thing that I would change would
be my toString() method.
