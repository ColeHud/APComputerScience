***************************   PMR  **************************************
 
<+s>: Code reusability was a Godsend on this assignment. So many of my previous methods were 
really easy to implement here. One thing that I found helpful was to constantly be testing, 
rather than wait until I finished all of the methods.
      
<-s>: Pretty much nothing went wrong. This was one of the smoothest challenge programs ever because of how simple
it was to implement the algorithms I'd written on other assignments.
           
*************************************************************************
I really liked to learn about some of these cool algorithms this module. Looking ahead, I see some even better algorithms.
I can't wait! If I were to do this assignment over again, I wouldn't change anything!
