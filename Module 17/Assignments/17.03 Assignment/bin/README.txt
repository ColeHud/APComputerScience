<+s>: This assignment went relatively well, but I did have a few bumps in the road. I was able to reuse
a lot of code, which was super helpful. One thing that helped me was to write my own version of a selection
sort before seeing any examples. This gave me a much better understanding of how everything worked.
      
<-s>: My selection sort that I wrote was for ArrayLists, so I had a bit of difficulty getting it to work
with normal arrays. The temp object turned out to be a really good solution for this.
           
*************************************************************************
In the future, I would write my test sort using arrays rather than arraylists. This would make things much
easier for me. Other than that, everything was a breeze!
