<+s>: Once I got the hang of things, everything went well. Most of the methods were
really similar, so it was easy to create the year and studio methods once I had the title
methods.
      
<-s>: I struggled to understand some of the example code this assignment, so I had to go through
and look it over a few extra times. It seems that the more things are optimized, the harder they
are to understand/read.

Even though I struggled a bit, I feel like I handled it pretty well. If I were to do this assignment
again, I wouldn't change much. I found it especially helpful to watch some youtube videos about
merge sorting.
