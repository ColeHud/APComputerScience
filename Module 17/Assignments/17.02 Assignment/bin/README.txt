<+s>: This assignment went pretty well for me. It took me a while to adjust to this new algorithm, but
it's starting to make sense to me. 
      
<-s>: For a while I did have difficulty understanding the algorithm. If I were to write the algorithm from scratch,
I would probably use more lines of code, but it would make more sense to me. I chose to use the algorithm provided, which
makes less sense, but is probably more efficient.
           
*************************************************************************
I'm going to try and spend some time getting better at this algorithm for the future. I'll try writing some different versions
that might make more sense to me. The provided example was kind of confusing for me.

P.S.

This week I've been learning some more objective-c. My Java experience has been really helpful.

2 nights ago I wrote this really simple and short Python script that makes creating the class
folders really easy. You launch the program, type in the module name, and the program does the rest.

I hope you've had a good Spring break. I'm writing this from the back seat of a van on my way home from Texas.
Sorry that I've fallen a bit behind this week; I've been spending a LOT of time with my cousins.

I'm part of the High School Hackers Facebook group and they're organizing study groups for each AP exam.
For the next month I'm going to be meeting with fellow hackers over skype to study for the exam. I'm excited!
