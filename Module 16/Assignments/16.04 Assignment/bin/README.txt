***************************   PMR  **************************************
 
<+s>: I was relatively happy with how this assignment went. Once I got it working, everything was dandy.
I changed some stuff this time around to make it easier to transition to the ArrayList class.
      
<-s>: I really struggled with the ArrayList section this time around. I spent quite a while trying to figure out
what was wrong. I ended up fixing the problem by initializing the ArrayLists to blank values.

While I had trouble with this assignment, I'm happy with how I dealt with the difficulty. A few well placed
println()'s and I was all set. Debugging is a skill that I definitely need to improve, though.
