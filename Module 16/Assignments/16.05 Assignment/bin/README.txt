<+s>: This assignment was a lot of fun, and I felt well-prepared for it. The assignments leading
up to the challenge program were super helpful. 
      
<-s>: I don't have anything bad to say about this assignment. Everything went according to plan.

I noticed a few things that I would like to change, so I made an alternate project that implements some things that
I'd want to do in the future.
