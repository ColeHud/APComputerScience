<+s>: Again, this assignment went pretty well. Even though the ArrayLists gave me some trouble,
the methods provided by ArrayList were really helpful. For a second I was really scared, because my output
was different from the example, but it turned out that the example added in the wrong value for Donald Mouse.
      
<-s>: For a few minutes I struggled with properly indexing the ArrayLists. Other than that this went
well.

I don't really have much to say about this assignment. It went pretty well and followed the path of previous assignments.
I like how these assignments build on each other, but at this point I'm about ready for the challenge program to shake things up.
