***************************   PMR  **************************************
 
<+s>: This assignment went well for me. The instructions told me really clearly everything that I had to accomplish.
Not much changed from the previous assignment, so I didn't have much room to do anything too great (or too terrible).
      
<-s>: I ran into some difficulty while creating the ArrayList version of the tester class. I kept on forgetting
to change the return type to an arraylist, so the IDE was complaining loudly.
           
*************************************************************************
In the future, I think it would be cool to create an election class to handle all of the data and the methods so that 
the tester classes don't get cluttered. Overall, I'm really liking this string of assignments.
