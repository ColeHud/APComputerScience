<+s>: This assignment went really well. The instructions were very clear. At first, I tried printing using
println, but I switched to printf in order to make the columns prettier. 
      
<-s>: I don't have anything bad to say about this assignment, the instructions didn't give me many opportunities to make
mistakes. 
           
*************************************************************************
I've been liking the past few assignments because they seem to have some grounding in reality; that they could 
be actually applicable programs. I've also enjoyed how the subsequent assignments build off of each other. I think that
this is a good form, and I hope that it continues in the future.
