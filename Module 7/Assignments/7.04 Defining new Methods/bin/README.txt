<+s>: This program went extremely well! I wrote code for almost an hour, and when I pressed run, everything just worked!
      
<-s>: I messed up printing to the text file the first time around.

In the future I would love programs to go as well as this, but I should also probably do some unit tests. This program 
would probably have been more user friendly if the user were prompted for their weight rather than hard-coding it into 
the program. My values in this program are a couple pounds off, but as my math teacher says, "Good enough for the girls we
go out with."
