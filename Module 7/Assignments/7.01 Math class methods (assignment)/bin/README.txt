<+s>: A wrote down some pseudocode (during history class) that turned out to work pretty well once I implemented it.
I'm beginning to really like the flexibility that "printf()" gives me, and it was pretty easy for me to use this time.
      
<-s>: I was rather disappointed that I couldn't use a for-each loop. At first I had trouble figuring out if my data input was correct.
I don't know what's wrong, but certain radii work, and others don't.

Work: 1.0, 1.3
Don't: 1.2, 1.4
           
*************************************************************************
In the future I want to figure out what's going wrong with my different radii, I get the feeling it has to do with the way I get
the number of indices in an array.
