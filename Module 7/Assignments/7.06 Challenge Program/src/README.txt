<+s>: Again, I love writing methods. It makes everything so much easier. I really liked this project 
and it amazed me that you could calculate pi like this. 
      
<-s>: Originally everything was outputting as pi = 0, but then I realized that I had forgotten to type-cast some values. After
that everything worked well.

I was really pleased with my debugging tactics, now I'll be able to use the same technique in the future. In the future I 
need to try not to make silly mistakes (like type-casting).
