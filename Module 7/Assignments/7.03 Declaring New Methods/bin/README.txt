<+s>: Again, I'm really loving finally being able to use methods. I like how they make the programs work, and it makes them much
easier to write.
      
<-s>: I had a few goof-ups with formatting my output, but nothing major. Other than that this program went really well.

I went through section 7.03 and saw that the assignment wasn't actually due, so I didn't due it, but come section 7.04, I 
just realized that I had to do it. Whups. In the future I need to do all of the assignments even if they're not due right away.
