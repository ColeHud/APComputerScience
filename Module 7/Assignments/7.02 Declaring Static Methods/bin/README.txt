<+s>: This project went really well for me. Having the partially finished program structure was really helpful. This was a relatively simple program, but it really shows how powerful
methods can be.
      
<-s>: There aren't many bad things that happened. I got confused a few times by the comments, but everything turned out ok in the end.

In the future, now that methods are available, I'm going to use them a TON! Methods are one of my favorite parts of programming; I love how you can have so many distributed tasks
that all work together.

Note: Some of my calculations may be slightly off, but I used the values given to me from Google search.
