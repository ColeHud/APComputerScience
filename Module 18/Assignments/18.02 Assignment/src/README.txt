<+s>: This assignment went pretty well. I was able to slightly alter previous code in order to get everything working.
Almost everything went perfectly. The binary search made a lot of really cool sense to me, so it was pretty
simple to implement.I chose to use the merge sort for the titles to make sure that everything was super fast. What
would be the point of using binary search, if you were sorting the array with insertion sort?
      
<-s>: Basically nothing went wrong with this assignment. I did try programming outside in the nice weather, but
my screen wasn't bright enough.

If I were to do this assignment again, I wouldn't change anything. 

This past week, I studied with some fellow APCS students over Google Hangouts. We went over some free response
questions, and tried handwriting some Java. In a few hours, I'll be hosting another one!
