<+s>: This assignment went by pretty smoothly. The great thing about the algorithms that
we've been learning is that I'm pretty much able to just drop them into any new assignment.
This assignment resembled a lot of the ones leading up to it, so the thought process was
relatively the same.
      
<-s>: I messed up the substring of the bday month so that it was one character off. I also
forgot to add some of the headers to each search query.

I don't have much else to say about this assignment. I can kind of tell that things are starting
to slow down. Right now I'm just getting excited for the AP Exam!
