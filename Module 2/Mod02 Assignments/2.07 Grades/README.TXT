<+s>: Setting up the structure for this program was really easy. I like how we were given freedom to solve the problem ourselves, yet we could look back at the AdmissionsV1 class as an example.
      
<-s>: I don't really have anything bad to say about this program. Everything went pretty well for me.

I can definitely see how this program would be a great use case for user-defined functions after we learn how to make them. All of the operations are the same in each block of code, just the test scores are different. I could see creating a function that would accept a test score as an argument, and then it would do all of the data calculations and print out the results.
