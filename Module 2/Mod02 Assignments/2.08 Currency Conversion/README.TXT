<+s>: I was pretty quickly able to come up with my own algorithm to solve this problem. 
I created a good number of variables so that everything could be changed along with future 
spendings and conversion rates.
      
<-s>: There is probably a much easier way to solve this problem than the way that I took.
Also, I deleted all of the previous code provided and started from scratch. It might have
been a good idea to keep the code that they had written for me.
           
*************************************************************************
I used Google's Currency converter for my currency conversion rates. In the future I might
want to try out some different algorithms to find the one that is the most efficient.
