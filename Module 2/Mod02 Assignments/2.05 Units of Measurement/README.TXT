<+s>: I made a lot less silly mistakes this time! I didn't have to recompile even once for a semicolon error! I can definitely feel my programming habits improving. I really like how these programs are organized in the different modules; it makes it a lot easier to find my mistakes. Naming variables was also really easy and I think that if I were to ever look over this program again, it would be very intuitive.
      
<-s>: Sometimes I goofed up and used the wrong unit converter            (yardsPerMeter instead of metersPerYard). Sometimes I was unsure of the abbreviations of some of the units and I had to ask people for help.

I worked on half of this assignment one day, and half on another day. All of my comments made it really easy to pick back up again. In the future I would like to continue commenting my programs well to make them more readable.
