<+s>: It's really working out well using Sublime text to edit everything. It makes formatting my code very easy. I was glad to see that ints and doubles are the same as in C++.
      
<-s>: About 3-4 times during this assignment I forgot the semicolon at the end of a line. It is easily fixable, but I really need to work on remembering that. One other time I forgot to capitalize the "N" in one of the variable names which slowed me down again.

I really want to work on not making any silly little errors; they slow me down, and they break my focus on the important parts of the code. Looking back at the .java file I see lots of repeated sections. If this weren't an assignment, I would really like to get it to follow "DRY" principles (Don't Repeat Yourself). Seeing all of the repeated blocks of code, I know that there is a better way to do this. In the future I would like to be able to take this program and simplify it so that there aren't as many repeated blocks.
