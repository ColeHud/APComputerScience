***************************   PMR  **************************************
 
<+s>: This project was similar to others and was really easy after going over the desk check provided.
      
<-s>: My formatting was off, so I had to take time to go back and fix my artwork because it wasn't displaying properly.
           
*************************************************************************
In the future I would probably want to assign this all to one string variable for ease of use, as well as a lot less typing. I would also want to try to not make any more formatting mistakes.
