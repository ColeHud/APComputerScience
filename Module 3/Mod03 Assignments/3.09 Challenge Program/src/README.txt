<+s>: Printing out the receipt was pretty easy. All of the string methods were pretty fresh in 
my head which made them easy to recall.
      
<-s>: I didn't think through the beginning very well, so I spent nearly 15 minutes just figuring 
out how to get the user name. I was originally trying to collect it all as one string, but then I 
realized that it would be a lot easier to collect them as individual tokens.

In the future I would probably be a bit more specific with my pseudocode so that I would have all
of the algorithms finished beforehand, rather than trying to create them on the spot.
