<+s>: Taking my time with the StringPractice desk check and doing lots of the challenges really prepared me for this well. Setting up the code for this was pretty straightforward.
      
<-s>: I don't really have any negatives for this, everything went pretty well. I guess that I could have been more creative in my text message.

I just checked the java site api site, and I found the "toLowerCase()" method. In the future it would be cool to implement that so that you could abbreviate the message even if there were upper case letters in it.
