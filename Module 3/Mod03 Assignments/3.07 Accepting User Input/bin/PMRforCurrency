<+s>: Adding in the Scanner class was really easy to do. This form of input is a lot different
from other methods that I've used in other languages, but I quite like it.
      
<-s>: It has taken me forever to get this working! My code was fine, but something went wrong with
the Bluej editor, so I wrote all of this in Eclipse. I will probably be using eclipse from here
on out because I like it a lot. 
           
*************************************************************************
Like I said earlier, in the future I will probably be using Eclipse so that I don't run
into any of Bluej's problems. I looked into it, and Bluej didn't have any problems importing the 
library, but it quit working when I created the new Scanner(System.in).
