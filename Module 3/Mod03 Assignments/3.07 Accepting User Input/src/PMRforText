***************************   PMR  **************************************
 
<+s>: Adding in the scanner class was pretty simple. I didn't hardly have to change anything.
This was really the logical next step for where the program should go, and I think that it's a great
way to learn how to use the Scanner class. 
      
<-s>: Like I said in my other PMR, it took me forever to realize that I had to switch IDE.
I kept on thinking it was my mistake, but the code that I wrote didn't run in Bluej, but it did
run in Eclipse.
           
*************************************************************************
In the future I would probably want to add in the ability to expand on a text message, where if someone's 
message was: "brb I gtg", it would then return "be right back I got to go".
