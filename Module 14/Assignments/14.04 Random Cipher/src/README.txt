***************************   PMR  **************************************
 
<+s>: This assignment went much better for me than the previous one. I was able to draw upon existing code which was
really helpful. 
      
<-s>: I don't really have anything negative to say about this assignment. I thought that it went really well.
           
*************************************************************************
In the future I wouldn't change much about this assignment. One thing to note is that I DIDN'T make this with only 3 classes.
I added in a 4th class in order to support the naming convention that the assignment gave. It didn't make sense to put 
deciphering into ColeHudsonCipherTester. I thought that it would make much more sense to divide it up into 2 tester classes.
