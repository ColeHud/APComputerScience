<+s>: This project was really satisfying once I finished it. It was crazy to see primes 1-100,000 printed out
in this program that I'd written. I'm beginning to see how these past few program could be put together to make 
something bigger, so I tried especially hard to make the SetOfPrimes compatible with future possibilities. I'm also
really getting the hang of using 'this.' It's great to have arguments with the same name as their instance variables.
      
<-s>: I struggled for a little bit trying to make it so that 1 wasn't counted as a prime number. I still remember that 
small explosion in my head when our 5th grade math teacher told us that 1 isn't a prime number.

In the future I think it would be cool to integrate this with some previous programs to create a better encryption program
discussed in the notes before this assignment.
