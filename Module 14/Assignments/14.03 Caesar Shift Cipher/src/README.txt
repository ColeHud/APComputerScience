<+s>: Once this project ran well, it was the best part of my day. 
      
<-s>: There was a lot that went wrong with this program. I ended up deleting all of my code once. I especially struggled

In the future I would try and draw up a better plan beforehand about how I was going to attack this assignment. It was really
rewarding in the end, but I had a lot of painful bumps along the way.
