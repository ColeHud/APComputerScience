***************************   PMR  **************************************
 
<+s>: This assignment went unbelievably quickly. There weren't many instance variables to change, so this went
really well.
      
<-s>: I don't have anything negative to say about this. 
           
*************************************************************************
In the future I hope that we apply this concept to a larger program, sort of like with what happened last assignment.
