<+s>: This went extremely well for me. From the beginning I knew exactly what to do, and it seemed that every line of code that I wrote
ran perfectly. If every assignment went this well, that would be really good for me.
      
<-s>: I messed up the naming conventions for the maximum and minimum categories. I also forgot to tally the number of each 
category before I had started writing the print statements, so I had to go back and redo that. 
           
*************************************************************************
Looking back I could have simplified the maximum, minimum, and averages to all run in one loop rather than a loop for each. In the future
I would probably do that. But overall, this assignment couldn't have gone much better.
