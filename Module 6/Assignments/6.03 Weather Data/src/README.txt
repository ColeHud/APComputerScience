<+s>: I'm really happy with how this program turned out. Everything was going well, but then my equation for finding the heat
index didn't work. Within a short time I was able to get it to work by using an alternate formula off of the heat index Wikipedia page.
I learned a lot from the 5.06 assignment last week, and I didn't make any of the same mistakes here.
      
<-s>: As these programs are getting longer, program organization is becoming more important and I'm falling behind in that area. I 
didn't organize this program as well as I could have. Adding all of the cx variables seems a bit much in hindsight, but it really helped
me out while writing the equation. Thanks Wikipedia!

In the future I would pay more attention to the complex equation and work on getting that squared down first, rather than working on
it halfway through the program. Other than the things that I mentioned above, I'm really pleased with how this went and I wouldn't 
change much in the future.
