<+s>: While using Objective-C I was a bit confused with the printf() statement, but now I understand it a lot better.
I think that my code turned out pretty well, and I didn't have to make any major changes. It felt really good to input the new 
data and to get out the values that I was hoping for. 
      
<-s>: While formatting the output, sometimes I didn't calculate the space correctly and I had to change it a couple times. 
Other than that I was pleased with how this assignment turned out.

I know that I've said this for the past few weeks in my PMRs, but I need to procrastinate less. It's going to be the death of me. 
I've been doing too many assignments on Sunday afternoons that I should've had done earlier in the week. I really need to work on this.
