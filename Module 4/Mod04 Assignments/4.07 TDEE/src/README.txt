<+s>: This project reminded me a lot of the math menu example and I was able to reuse lots of the
processes that I saw in that example. I was really happy about how well this program went, I've been
making a lot less mistakes than usual. It's a really good feeling when you run your code after a lot of
work and everything runs perfectly.
      
<-s>: I'm wishing that there was a better way to get the menu choice and set the TDEE than using
all of those if statements. It seems really repetitive and I probably could have found a more
efficient way of doing it.
           
*************************************************************************
In the future I'd like to be able to find a way to write all of those if statements more efficiently.
