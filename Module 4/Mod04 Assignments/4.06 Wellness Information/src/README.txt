***************************   PMR  **************************************
 
<+s>: I really liked that we had the basic structure already in place, along with how similar this was to the MathMenu.java example. These 2 things made
this assignment pretty simple.
      
<-s>: I probably added in some unnecessary work by making the boxes around the menu items. Other than that everything went really well.

Since this is a menu oriented assignment, I think it would be really cool to eventually recreate this using a GUI and have a window pop up. I looked into this
and maybe after I learn more about the awt class I could do this.
