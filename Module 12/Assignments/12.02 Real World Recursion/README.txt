<+s>: I enjoyed making the Mondrian art. My idea came to me really quickly after learning that one corner had to be complex and the other didn't.
      
<-s>: I'm still struggling to understand some of the examples of recursion. I hope that it get's cleared up once I have to start writing programs with it. 
           
*************************************************************************
In the future I think that it would be cool to write a program that does exactly this. If I were to make another piece of Mondrian art I would probably try to add more colors and complexity.
