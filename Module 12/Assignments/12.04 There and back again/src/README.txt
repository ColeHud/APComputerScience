***************************   PMR  **************************************
 
<+s>: Once I began to understand recursion this assignment went really well. The tester classes are almost
the same which made writing them easy.
      
<-s>: I'm really wishing that I'd chosen to write this all in one class. They were all so similar that one class
should've been able to handle it. 
           
*************************************************************************
In the future I think that it would be cool to write this with more than two parts of the piecewise function. I'm probably
going to end up recreating these programs in my calculator to use in pre-calc at school.
