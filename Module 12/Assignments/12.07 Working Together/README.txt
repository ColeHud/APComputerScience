<+s>: It was really fun getting to work with one of my classmates! It was an interesting experience,
and I hope that we get an opportunity to do that again.
      
<-s>: I didn't finish all of my work on time, so my partner had to work on this assignment over the weekend.

If I could do this all over again I would try and start the assignment sooner. In the future I think it would
be cool to do something like this but where we write actual code.
