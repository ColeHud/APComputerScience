<+s>: I was super happy when this finally worked! Recursion is strange because if you try and think about it
everything is so weird. You just need to sort of trust that it will work.
      
<-s>: I still had some trouble with recursion on this one. I'm going to try and get some more practice with it 
because it sounds like it's covered heavily on the AP Exam.

In the future I would give this program a better way to handle non-alphabetic characters. Other than that I'm
really pleased with how it turned out.
