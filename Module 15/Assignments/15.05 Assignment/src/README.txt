***************************   PMR  **************************************
 
<+s>: This assignment went really well for me. The instructions were pretty straightforward and didn't give me
many places to make mistakes.
      
<-s>: At some points the instructions were confusing, so I had to make some guesses as to how the program should go.
           
*************************************************************************
If I were to do this assignment again I would change much. The only thing that could be better would be the instructions which
weren't always that clear or logical. Other than that, this was a great assignment, even though it was a bit simple for a 
challenge program.
