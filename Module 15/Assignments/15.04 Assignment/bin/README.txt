<+s>: Again this assignment went by really well because of how much it drew from previous code. It showed how useful 
the Comparable<T> interface is, and I'm beginning to understand interfaces a lot better.
      
<-s>: I don't really have anything negative to say about this assignment; it went without a problem.

In the assignment instructions it showed an example of checking if two homework assignments had the same number of pages, but
I didn't really like this application. The assignment said to demonstrate the compareTo() method, so I thought that it would
be much cooler to use the Collection.sort() method which is much more applicable to this assignment.
