<+s>: This assignment was really easy. I was able to use almost all of my code from the last assignment, and the new
code didn't add many lines.
      
<-s>: There weren't any things that went wrong with this assignment, but I'm really confused why we made an interface.
I experimented around with removing parts of code, and I found out that I could just move the doReading() method to 
Homework2, and everything would work out just fine. To me this doesn't seem like a great situation to use an interface.
           
*************************************************************************
In the future I want to get a better idea of when to use interfaces and when to use abstract classes; right now the line
in between them doesn't make much sense to me.
