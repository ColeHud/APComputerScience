<+s>: Overall, this assignment went really well. The instructions made everything crystal clear, and it was a pretty
easy assignment to begin with. Before this I'd seen and messed around with implementations and abstract classes, but this
is giving me a much better picture of them.
      
<-s>: My TestHomework class looks kind of ugly. I was really hoping to be able to do something like:

homework.add(new MyMath(); this.createAssignment(4););
                         ( ^ where this refers to the new MyMath object)

,but unfortunately that doesn't work.
           
*************************************************************************
In the future I'm looking to see how important these abstract classes are. Right now it seems like they don't really provide 
that many benefits, but I'm sure that my view will change soon. Also, if there's a way to do something similar to my code 
statement in the <-s> section, please let me know :)
